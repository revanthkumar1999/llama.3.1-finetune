# Text-to-SQL Generation with QLoRA Fine-Tuning

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune a **LLaMA-3.1 model** using **QLoRA** to generate SQL queries from natural language text. The fine-tuned model simplifies database interaction by allowing users to ask questions in plain language and receive accurate SQL queries.

## üöÄ **Overview**
**Goal**: Convert user-provided text questions (e.g., "What is the total sales in 2020?") into SQL queries for querying structured databases.

**Why QLoRA?**
- **Quantized LoRA (QLoRA)** combines:
  - **Quantized Weights**: Reduces precision to 4-bit, lowering computational costs.
  - **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Efficient fine-tuning by modifying only a small subset of model parameters.
- This makes QLoRA an ideal choice for resource-efficient model fine-tuning.
